Example Implementation of Vectorized Kalman Filter &amp; IMM with Pytorch

This `vectorized_kalman.py` belongs to larger private codebase. This repo is only intended to serve as a reference for a "parallel" implementation of Kalman filter. We use it to process thousands of vehicle trajectories at once.

The speed up is immense when compared to Filterpy
